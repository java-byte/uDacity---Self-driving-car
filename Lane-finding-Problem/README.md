# Lane-finding-Problem (Project -1)

This is first project for uDacity- Self driving car Nanodegree Program. In this first project we have to find the white lane line on the road.
We are taking straight line into consideration for this first project. I have designed pipeline to find the lane line on road and draw a straight line for car which need to be followed by driverless car.
